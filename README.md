## :angry: Hack not working?!
Make an issue (if it is not already), notify me, but before that,
be sure the links to be the same as above! (look carefully if the links are the same!)

The cheat is updating regularly so you need to change values too...

And don't forget to press ctrl + f5 when going to surviv.io website

## :rage: Hack Freezing?!
Surviv.io has an anti-cheat system that sometimes makes the game freeze (stop), so I need time to investigate this and fix.
